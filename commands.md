## Commands

There's a couple commands you can use with this bot. The biggest one being `!wishwall` which displays wish inputs for the Last Wish raid in Destiny 2.

| Wish | Phrase                         |
|------|--------------------------------|
| 1    | `key` `etherial key`           |
| 2    | `chest` `ship` `palla galliot` |
| 3    | `emblem` `numbers of power`    |
| 4    | `shuro chi`                    |
| 5    | `morgeth` `ogre`               |
| 6    | `vault`                        |
| 7    | `riven`                        |
| 8    | `music` `paul`                 |
| 9    | `failsafe` `the worst thing`   |
| 10   | `drifter`                      |
| 11   | `gbp`                          |
| 12   | `heads`                        |
| 13   | `petra` `flawless`             |

So inputting `!wishwall vault` would display wish 6 which teleports you to the vault encounter.

There's a few non-wish wishes too because I couldn't be bothered making a new command.

| Phrase       | What it does                                                         |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `labs`       | Link to solutions of Niobe Labs puzzle                               |
| `nightfalls` | Displays nightfall leaderboards for the "After The Nightfall" emblem |
